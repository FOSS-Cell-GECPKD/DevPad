Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is _actually_ written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript based web framework!
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Simple and Efficient No SQL Database.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Material UI] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - efficient and light weight text editor

And of course DevPad is a open source project with a [public repository](https://github.com/FOSS-Cell-GECPKD/DevPad)[dill]
on GitHub.
